# Rapid

Rapid bot is a music player that has some basic utility built in

For the bot to work, you will need your bots unique token and you will also need to change the variables in src/tools.py to a directory on your computer.
In the src folder, you will need to create 3 folders called, "history", "downloads", and "playlists".

You will also need to install "google images downloader" for the image_cog.py to work properly, but the bot is usable with or without this.

To understand how to use the bot use -help when you get the bot online.  It has all the information and commands for the bot.
